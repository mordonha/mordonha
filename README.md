👋 Hi, I’m Paulo Marcos Ordonha

👀 I’m passionate about movies, anime, comics/manga, music/soundtracks, and reading—all kinds of it. 
I’m also taking contemporary dance classes.

🌱 Currently, I’m learning Python (core concepts, testing, NumPy, Pandas, and data science fundamentals), JavaScript (vanilla, along with React and Node), and a bit of  design.

👨🏾‍💻 I work with tagging, tracking, data collection, and analysis of digital products across web and app platforms, including Google Tag Manager (Web & Server), Google Analytics 4, BigQuery, Looker, and Excel tricks.
